    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Lab-Rinth is a 2D platformer game where you step into the shoes of a misunderstood SCP trying to break free from a high-security lab. Unlike the traditional SCP lore, where anomalies are confined due to their perceived danger, this game flips the narrative. You are now a benevolent SCP seeking freedom, relying on stealth and strategy to outwit your captors and avoid detection.</p>
    <p>The inspiration behind Lab-Rinth comes from a deep appreciation for the rich and diverse stories within the SCP Foundation universe. As an avid fan, the idea of portraying an SCP as a non-threatening entity was intriguing. This game challenges the conventional portrayal of SCPs as inherently dangerous, offering a fresh perspective where a "Safe" SCP seeks a peaceful escape. Unlike many platformers, Lab-Rinth emphasizes non-violence. You navigate the game as a pacifist SCP, relying on stealth and memorization rather than combat.</p>
