        <div class="strengths">
            <h2>Strengths</h2>
            <p>As a team, one thing we did exceptionally well was integrating everyone’s ideas into a cohesive game design that we all agreed upon. This collaborative effort is evident in our consistent theme and the way we gathered and utilized assets that fit perfectly with our vision. We maintained a unified direction throughout the development process, which is reflected in the final product’s polished and harmonious look and feel – at least the “looks” part of the game. Our ability to take feedback from play testers and make thoughtful adjustments based on that input also stands out as a significant strength. This iterative process of refinement ensured that our game became more engaging and enjoyable with each playtest.</p>

        <div class="priorities">
            <h2>If we had more time...</h2>
            <p>If we had another two weeks to work on the game, our three highest priority items would be:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Adding more levels. The game is already fun to play, and adding more levels would significantly enhance the overall experience, providing more content and challenges for players to enjoy.</li>
                <li>Polishing enemy mechanics. We would focus on further refining the behavior of enemies, especially the projectile-shooting mechanics, and also add more features into the enemy such as adding more difficult enemies by having them move around instead of switching direction, or enemies coming towards the player.</li>
            </ol>
